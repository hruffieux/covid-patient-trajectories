** R Shiny app - FPCA estimation for patient-level inflammation & molecular trajectories

To deploy (after rstudio IDE linked to the BSU shinyapps account - use token):

library(rsconnect)
deployApp()

Also copy the latest version in the BSU home directory (~/ShinyApps/covid-patient-trajectories) for testing/troubleshooting and for when the BSU IT team moves from the shinyapps.io service to their own Shiny server.
